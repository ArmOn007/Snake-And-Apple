# Snake-And-Apple

This project is for implementing Q-learning and SARSA algorithms for the Snake-And-Apple game.
The code will first learn Q-table then try its best to get the apple.
We can't play the full game with these two algorithms. So, we just reach the first apple that appears on the map.
Something like solving the maze.
To do the full game, we need to do it with Deep Q-Learning.
